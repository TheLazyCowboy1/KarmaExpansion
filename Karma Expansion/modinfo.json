  "description": "Adds 12 additional karma! Now you can earn up to 22 karma. Also adds gates for each new karma value.<LINE><LINE>This mod was designed to complement my Region Randomizer mod. It got boring having the randomizer be beatable with only 4 echoes... A 16 echo requirement sounds better.<LINE>Alternatively, this mod can be used as a form of easy mode, since it allows the player to obtain more karma than usual. It also rewards finding echoes after receiving the mark of communication.<LINE><LINE>KNOWN ISSUES:<LINE>* Five Pebbles will NOT raise your karma if you visit him with a cap of 10 AND a current value of 10.<LINE>* Modded iterators, like Chasing Wind, are currently untested. They may reset your karma cap down to 10 if encountered (if so, let me know so I can fix it).<LINE>* Sprites are fuzzy and require a rework.",
