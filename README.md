# Karma Expansion

This mod expands the karma cap to 22 simply by changing a few lines of code that would normally cap the player's karma to 10.

This is a pretty low-quality mod. There's not much reason to look at its code. IL hooks would definitely be the preferred way to do all of this, but I didn't know IL hooks at the time I made it.
